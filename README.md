# Hangman Game
 A game of hangman - you have to guess a word selected by the code randomly in a given number of attempts

how to play::

the code randomly picks a word from the words.txt file and you have to guess it. it tells you how many letters the word has.

 to make the game easier,you may as well know the vovels appearing in the word.
 
 you will be initially given 6 guesses to guess the letters appearing in the word. each time you make a wrong guess,the number og guesses decreases by one. while it does not change when you make a correct guess. each time you make the right guess,the partially guessed word is displayed. 

 you may even opt for a hint by pressing '*' which displays all the possible words from the dictionary that fit the currently guessed partial word.

 you can only enter letters and that too only one letter at a time. if you enter anything else, a warning is displayed. game ends on the 3rd warning.
